A Blackboard Building Block to integrate WeBWorK with Blackboard.

Works with Blackboard v9.1. Does SSO and transfers webwork scores to Blackboard.

If you just want to install the building block in your Blackboard instance, then you just need the file webworkBuildingBlock.war.
(For it to be useful, you also need a webwork installation which has the soap service running.)

For configuration information see

http://webwork.maa.org/wiki/Blackboard

Ongoing development is being done by the [University of Missouri's Application Developer's Network](http://adn.missouri.edu/).
The building block is based on code originally developed by the IT group at the University of Rochester and graciously
provided to MU for continued development.

This repository intended to be a mirror of the active [svn repository](http://webwork.maa.org/viewvc/bbplugin/trunk/).
